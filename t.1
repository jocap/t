.Sh NAME
.Nm t
.Nd open another terminal in same directory
.
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm td
.Op Ar command ...
.
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm t
opens another terminal in the same directory as the currently focused
terminal window.

It relies on the
.Nm xtitle
tool to fetch the title of the current terminal window.
This string should consist of the current path.
In my
.Li .kshrc ,
I achieve this using the following code:
.
.Bd -literal -offset 6n
PS1=$PS1'\\[\\e]2;$PWD\\a\\]' # set title to pwd on every prompt
.Ed

If
.Nm t
detects that the title string is an existant directory, it opens a
terminal in that directory.
If it is a file, it opens the terminal in the dirname of that file.

If the path does not exist, the terminal is opened in the user's home
directory.

.Sh PARAMETERS

.
.Sh CUSTOMIZATION

.Nm t

To change this, edit the C source.
